## Introduction

In this repository, you will find different implementations of binary trees, including binary search trees, AVL trees, and red-black trees. Each implementation is provided in a separate directory, organized by programming language.

## Features

- Binary search tree implementation
- AVL tree implementation
- Red-black tree implementation
- Insertion, deletion, and search operations
- Tree traversal algorithms (pre-order, in-order, post-order)

## Usage

To use the binary tree implementations, you can import the necessary classes or modules into your own code. Each implementation provides a set of methods for performing common operations on binary trees.
